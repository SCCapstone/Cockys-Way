The fireApp uses Firebase Cloud Database (FC) services.
FC stores the data that the user inputs through the app.
This would allow users to store a favorite location or settings preferences, for example.

I accomplished these functions by setting up a database on Google's Firebase service,
and then integrating fireApp/FirebaseConfig.ts

To run, you must have the ability to run the Expo app natively or using an emulator.
You can then launch the app from the relative directory: research-CyberneticMedic/fireApp

Why is this important?
I now have the framework I need to test development with my team.
Our team needs to be able to store and retrieve data in real-time.
FC supports this by providing a reliable location to read and write data.
FC also prevents any issues stemming from lack of or unreliable storage...
...by team members and their personal technology.
