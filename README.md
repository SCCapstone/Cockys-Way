# Cockys-Way

We are making a navigation app tailored to students at the UofSC for the purpose of efficient navigation with GPS, and schedule management.
The app will be able to navigate to specific locations on campus and have
the ability to save locations as 'favorites'. The app will also allow
students to view information about their classes and professors, including
location, time, office hours, and title. The app will integrate Firebase DB
in order to save user settings, favorites, account, and other like information.

## External Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository onto your computer
2. Download Expo CLI on system with `npm install -g expo-cli`
3. Download and install Node
4. Verify `node -v` and `npm -v`
5. Download Expo Go mobile app
6. Run `npm install` in root directory of the cloned repo to get dependencies
7. Run `npx expo start`
8. Scan QR code with phone camera
9. App will open within Expo Go app

## Running

- Ensure both your computer and phone are connected to the same local network
