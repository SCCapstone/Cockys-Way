    We are making a navigation app tailored to students at the UofSC
for the purpose of efficient navigation with GPS, and schedule management.
The app will be able to navigate to specific locations on campus and have
the ability to save locations as 'favorites'. The app will also allow 
students to view information about their classes and professors, including
location, time, office hours, and title. The app will integrate Firebase DB
in order to save user settings, favorites, account, and other like information.
